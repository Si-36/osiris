# AURA Fix Progress Report

## âœ… Completed So Far

### 1. Architecture Understanding
- Mapped complete flow: Input â†’ TDA â†’ Intelligence â†’ Orchestration â†’ Execution â†’ Memory
- Identified 54 folders with specific purposes
- Found TDA as core innovation (112 algorithms for topology analysis)

### 2. Utils Folder (100% Complete)
- âœ… decorators.py - Completely rewritten with 2025 patterns:
  - Adaptive circuit breakers
  - Retries with jitter
  - Token bucket rate limiting
  - Performance monitoring
  - TTL caching
- âœ… logger.py - Working
- âœ… logging.py - Working
- âœ… validation.py - Working

### 3. Core Folder (78% Complete) 
- 14/18 files have valid syntax
- 8 files can be imported successfully
- Fixed critical config.py indentation issues
- Still need to fix:
  - consciousness.py (complex indentation issues)
  - system.py (partially fixed)
  - testing.py (malformed try/except)
  - topology.py (function indentation)

## ðŸš§ Current Blockers

### 1. Missing Dependencies
Without pip install capability, these are blocking:
- httpx (for API calls)
- pydantic_settings (for config)
- neo4j (for graph database)
- redis (for caching)
- kafka (for streaming)
- gudhi/ripser (for TDA)

### 2. Import Chain Issues
- Main __init__.py imports infrastructure/gemini_client
- gemini_client needs httpx
- This cascades and blocks most imports

### 3. Syntax Error Pattern
Appears to be systematic corruption from bad automated editing:
- Wrong indentation after if/else/try
- Misplaced pass statements
- Functions at wrong indent level
- Multiple except blocks

## ðŸ“Š Statistics

- **Total Python Files**: 585
- **Files with Errors**: 356 (60.9%)
- **Folders**: 54
- **Fixed So Far**: ~20 files
- **Progress**: ~3.4%

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Focus)
1. Complete fixing core/ folder (4 files left)
2. Fix infrastructure/ folder to unblock imports
3. Fix resilience/circuit_breaker.py (already found broken)

### Short Term
1. Fix TDA folder (CRITICAL - core innovation)
2. Fix memory/ folder (hierarchical system)
3. Fix agents/ folder (orchestration)

### For Testing
Need either:
1. Install dependencies (pip install httpx neo4j redis)
2. Create comprehensive mocks for all external deps
3. Fix imports to be conditional/lazy

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. **Consider Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv aura_env
   source aura_env/bin/activate
   pip install httpx pydantic neo4j redis
   ```

2. **Systematic Fix Approach**
   - Fix by dependency order (core â†’ utils â†’ infrastructure â†’ features)
   - Test each folder completely before moving on
   - Document all changes

3. **Architecture Improvements**
   - Make external dependencies optional
   - Add fallback implementations
   - Improve error messages

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learning

The codebase has sophisticated architecture but suffered from:
1. Automated refactoring that broke indentation
2. Tight coupling to external dependencies
3. No working tests to catch issues

With systematic fixing, AURA can achieve its vision of "seeing the shape of failure before it happens"!
