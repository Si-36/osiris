# AURA Infrastructure Monitor

Intelligent infrastructure monitoring using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Liquid Neural Networks (LNN).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the API server:**
   ```bash
   cd api
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Open the demo:**
   Visit http://localhost:8000/demo in your browser

## 📊 Features

- Real-time infrastructure monitoring
- Topology-aware failure prediction
- Multi-agent consensus for decisions
- WebSocket streaming for live updates

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Infrastructure Metrics → TDA Analysis → LNN Prediction → Agent Decision → Alert
```

## 💡 Next Steps

1. Integrate real TDA engine from core/src/aura_intelligence
2. Add LNN predictions
3. Implement agent system
4. Build production UI
5. Deploy to Kubernetes

## 📈 Value Proposition

Predict infrastructure failures 2-4 hours before they happen, saving $50K+ per prevented outage.
