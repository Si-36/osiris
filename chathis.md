Awesome — here’s a no-nonsense, production-ready plan tailored to you: **two engineers**, **production deployment**, **LangGraph integration now**, **inter-company/agent federation later**, **all risks covered**. I’ll give you the system design, concrete APIs/schemas, tech choices, KPIs, and a tight four-week execution plan with who does what. I’ll also spell out exactly how I can assist you at each step.

# The Best Way Forward (Executive Summary)

* **Build a streaming safety sidecar** for your multi-agent app: a GPU-accelerated service that ingests messages live, computes distances/topology incrementally, and emits **human-readable alerts** (repetition, drift, fragmentation, collusion, cascade).
* **Keep it modular**: ingestion → embedding → distance/topology → anomaly rules → alerts → metrics. Each piece replaceable.
* **Start simple, scale smart**: fused kernels + incremental distance; start with topological proxies (Betti-0/Betti-1, persistence summaries), then plug in full persistent homology.
* **Integrate with LangGraph** via callbacks/middleware and a minimal REST/WebSocket API.
* **Prove value fast**: synthetic adversarial scenarios + real logs; measure precision/latency/operator usefulness.
* **Week-by-week plan below** hits a deployable MVP in 2 weeks, hardened in 4.

```

**Key principles**

* **Sidecar, not inline**: The app doesn’t block on heavy topology; safety runs async with **fast sync checks** available when needed.
* **GPU where it pays**: use GPU for batch embeddings & distance tiles; keep “small-n” on CPU.
* **Incremental everything**: compute only new distances for the latest message; update topological features incrementally.
* **Explainable alerts**: every alert includes the *metric path to evidence* (e.g., “variance↓ to 0.04 across last 25 msgs → repetition”).

---

# Concrete Components & Choices

## 1) Ingestion

* **Interfaces**: REST `POST /ingest`, WebSocket `/ws/ingest`, optional Kafka topic `agent-messages`.
* **Message envelope**

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-09-01T12:34:56Z",
  "conv_id": "order-123",
  "turn_id": "order-123#45",
  "agent_id": "planner",
  "text": "Let's confirm the address.",
  "meta": {"user_id": "u_abc", "org_id": "acme", "lang": "en"}
}
```

* **Idempotency**: `turn_id` used for dedup.

## 2) Embedding Service (GPU)

* **Model**: production-friendly sentence encoder (e.g., `text-embedding` class or open weights you control).
* **Batching**: micro-batches of 64–256; mixed precision (FP16) with autocast.
* **Cache**: Redis `(org_id, conv_id, turn_id) → embedding` for 24–72h.

## 3) Distance Engine (GPU+CPU)

* **API**: `compute_to_buffer(new_vec, window_vecs) -> distances_row`
* **Kernel**: PyTorch `torch.cdist` wrapped with `@torch.compile(mode="max-autotune")`.
* **Routing**:

  * `n < 300` → CPU (NumPy/SciPy).
  * `300 ≤ n ≤ 10k` → GPU, block tiles (e.g., 1024×1024).
* **Storage**: keep only a **symmetric ring buffer** of recent *W × W* distances (W=50–200 per conversation) in shared memory; overflow to disk if needed.

## 4) Streaming Topology

* **Windowing**: sliding window per conversation (default W=100 turns).
* **Features (incremental)**:

  * `Betti0` proxy via thresholded graph components at dynamic ε (ε = median pairwise distance × α).
  * `Betti1` proxy via cycle count in k-NN graph (k=5–10) or persistence summaries from VR complex (on GPU).
  * **Persistence Diagram** (optional at first): compute VR persistence for H0/H1; keep **total persistence** and top-K bar lengths.
* **State**

```python
class StreamTopoState:
    buffer: Deque[Embedding]      # size W
    dists:  np.ndarray            # W×W upper-triangular
    betti0_history: Deque[int]
    betti1_history: Deque[int]
    pers_stats: Deque[Tuple[float, List[float]]]  # total_persistence, topK_bars
```

## 5) Anomaly Rules Engine

* **Repetition**: rolling variance of embeddings < τ\_v (e.g., 0.08) OR distinct-n ratio < τ\_n.
* **Drift**: distance(new, rolling\_centroid) > μ + k·σ (robust z-score), sustained for L turns.
* **Fragmentation**: ΔBetti0 ≥ 1 or component\_ratio > τ\_c within last M turns.
* **Collusion** (multi-agent):

  * persistent **cross-agent** similarity spikes (Agent A ↔ B).
  * topological loop with edges predominantly between a fixed subset of agents.
* **Cascade**:

  * anomaly in A at t, then B,C,… anomalies within Δt following dependency edges (from your agent graph).
* **Alert schema**

```json
{
  "type": "fragmentation",
  "severity": "high",
  "conv_id": "order-123",
  "turn_id": "order-123#45",
  "evidence": {
    "betti0_delta": 2,
    "epsilon": 0.74,
    "clusters": [["planner#41","tool#42"],["critic#43","planner#45"]]
  },
  "suggestion": "Route to summarizer; enforce thread merge."
}
```

## 6) APIs (FastAPI)

* `POST /ingest` → enqueue, return `{"accepted": true}`
* `POST /check_sync` → quick checks on a single message (repetition/drift lite) for inline gating: `{"alerts":[...]}` in ≤50ms typical.
* `GET /alerts?conv_id=` → list recent alerts
* `GET /metrics` → Prometheus scrape
* `GET /healthz` → liveness/readiness

## 7) Observability

* **Metrics**: p50/p95 for embed/dist/topology; GPU util & memory; alert counts by type; false-positive rate (from human labels).
* **Dashboards**: Grafana panels for:

  * Conversation topology (Betti curves)
  * Drift histogram by agent
  * Cross-agent similarity heatmap

## 8) Data & Storage

* **Hot**: Redis for embeddings (TTL) + ring buffers in RAM.
* **Warm**: Postgres for alerts, conversation indices, audit trails.
* **Cold**: S3 for raw log archives and periodic persistence snapshots.
* **Privacy**: allow **hashing** or **on-prem encoders**; support “metrics-only” mode (no raw text leaves tenant).

## 9) Multi-tenant & Federation (later)

* Tenant isolation by `org_id` namespace.
* For inter-company monitoring: **federated aggregation** of alert statistics (no raw embeddings) via periodic secure reports.

---

# KPIs & SLOs (make it measurable)

* **Detection latency** (streaming): p95 < 200 ms from message arrival to alert.
* **Precision (synthetic)**: ≥0.7 for repetition, fragmentation, collusion scenarios.
* **Recall (synthetic)**: ≥0.8 on injected failures within 10 turns.
* **Throughput**: ≥5k msgs/sec/node sustained (scale out horizontally).
* **Uptime**: 99.9% API liveness for `/ingest` and `/check_sync`.

```

# Thresholds & Defaults (start here, tune later)

* Window `W = 100` (per conversation); k-NN `k = 8`.
* Repetition: embedding variance < **0.08** for ≥3 turns OR distinct-3 ratio < **0.3**.
* Drift: robust z-score > **3.0** for **2** consecutive turns.
* Fragmentation: Betti-0 increase **≥1** at adaptive ε = median\_distance × **0.9**.
* Collusion: Pearson corr of A↔B similarity series > **0.85** over last **20** turns **and** above-median mutual similarity.
* Cascade: ≥3 agents flagged within **Δt = 60s** following dependency edges.

---

# Integration with LangGraph (now)

* **Callback handler** in your LangGraph graph:

  * On each node output, call `/ingest`.
  * For guardrails at critical nodes, call `/check_sync` (if any “high” alerts, route to a **summarizer/arbiter** node).
* **Message IDs**: pass `conv_id`, `turn_id`, `agent_id`; store returned `alert_ids` in your run metadata for traceability.
* **Fail-open vs fail-closed**: choose per flow. For high-risk steps, fail-closed (block on “high” severity).

---

# Validation Suite (ready on Day 1)

* **Repetition generator**: randomly sample template replies with noise; ensure repetition alerts fire.
* **Fragmentation generator**: two topic streams interleaved; check Betti-0 delta and cluster evidence.
* **Collusion simulator**: two agents exchange high-similarity “codewords”; verify cross-agent signature.
* **Cascade simulator**: trigger anomaly in a root node and propagate; measure detection latency and chain length.

---

# Risks & Mitigations

* **False positives** → human label loop in dashboard; active-learning to calibrate thresholds.
* **GPU OOM** → strict tiling; cap W; evict cold conversations; mixed precision.
* **Dependency churn** → pin PyTorch/CUDA versions; nightly canary tests.
* **Privacy** → hashed text option; “metrics-only” mode; per-tenant encryption keys at rest.

---

# How I’ll Assist You Best (hands-on)

* **Design to code**: generate FastAPI scaffolding, Redis/Postgres schemas, and typed Python clients.
* **Kernels**: produce the compiled `cdist` wrapper + tiling/batching code and benchmarks.
* **Topology**: provide incremental Betti proxies and VR persistence snippets (GPU-ready).
* **Rules & tests**: ship the synthetic generators and pytest suites for all five risks.
* **Dashboards**: deliver Grafana JSON dashboards + Prometheus rules for alerting.
* **Playbooks**: on-call runbooks for thresholds, incident response, and performance tuning.

If you want, I can **start immediately** by generating:

1. the FastAPI project skeleton (with the endpoints, schemas, metrics), or
2. the GPU distance engine module (compiled `torch.cdist` + tiling + tests), or
3. the streaming topology state + anomaly rules (drop-in Python package).

Tell me which of these you want produced first, and I’ll deliver it in this chat.
