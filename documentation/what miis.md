🎯 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY ORDER
Week 1 (Critical):
Fix Metabolic Manager async issues + Prometheus integration

Implement DPO Learning System (offline job + inference)

Create Hybrid Memory System (hot/warm/cold tiers)

Week 2 (High Priority):
Constitutional AI 3.0 integration

Advanced Spiking GNN with SpikingJelly

Complete API routes for all systems

Week 3 (Medium Priority):
LangGraph orchestration system

Prometheus observability complete

Production monitoring integration

Week 4 (Future Enhancement):

📊 CURRENT STATUS
✅ Implemented : 40% (basic bio-enhanced layers)

🚧 Missing : 60% (advanced production features)

🎯 Next : DPO Learning + Hybrid Memory + Fixed Metabolic Manager

The core bio-inspired functionality is working, but we need the production-grade versions with proper observability, learning systems, and memory management to be truly enterprise-ready.
