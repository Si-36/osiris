## Archived Files

### Consensus
- `byzantine.py` â†’ Enhanced with Bullshark, Cabinet, and Swarm features in `enhanced_byzantine.py`

### Collective 
- `collective/memory_manager.py` â†’ Features extracted to `memory/enhancements/collective_consensus.py`

## Transformation Summary

1. **Byzantine Consensus**: Enhanced with 2-round Bullshark, Cabinet weighted voting, post-quantum ready
2. **Collective Memory**: Extracted consensus building and CRDT features
3. **Distributed Orchestration**: Extracted Ray-based distributed computing
4. **Semantic Clustering**: Added to memory system from collective
