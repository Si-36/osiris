AURA Intelligence 2025 — Design Requirements, Implementation Plan, and Runbook
Below is the complete, production-focused design and execution plan to upgrade the current AURA stack to a 200+ component, CoRaL-enabled, TDA-enhanced, hybrid-memory system, wired into the Enhanced Ultimate API and runnable via your provided runner.

This plan assumes:

The 112-algorithm TDA engine is owned/maintained externally (no changes to that core).

We will integrate AURA coordination, CoRaL messaging, graph reasoning, DPO on ActionRecords, hybrid memory tiering, and LangGraph orchestration around it.

We will not introduce speculative biological constructs; we keep it rational, testable, and production-ready.

1) Design Requirements (DRD)
Objective

Orchestrate 200+ components as agents with clear separation of Information (IA) and Control (CA) roles.

Enable CoRaL-style emergent communication (message generation and causal influence regularization).

Integrate existing 112 TDA algorithms as decision features (not altering their internals).

Provide hybrid memory with DRAM(hot)/PMEM(warm)/Storage(cold) tiering for agent states, patterns, and topological signatures.

Expose a single Enhanced Ultimate API for operations and validation.

Maintain sub-millisecond end-to-end behavior for typical requests; track latency with Prometheus.

Scope

New subsystems:

Component Registry and Role Assignment

CoRaL Communication Layer (IA/CA messaging + causal influence estimator)

TDA Feature Adapters (lightweight)

Hybrid Memory Manager (tiering + telemetry)

DPO Learner for preference learning over ActionRecords

LangGraph-based Orchestrator (stateful, checkpointed)

Enhanced Ultimate API integration with new routes

No changes to: Your 112 TDA algorithm core.

Non-Goals

Quantum TDA implementations in this iteration.

Neuromorphic deployments (Loihi) in this iteration.

Full-blown multi-agent debate or MoA; we keep emergent messaging minimal and measurable.

Performance Targets

P50 decision latency ≤100–200μs for small payloads (excluding heavy TDA batch ops).

P99 ≤5ms under 200 concurrent components.

Memory tier hit-rate ≥90% served from hot/warm tiers.

CoRaL messaging overhead ≤10–15% CPU over baseline.

Observability & Safety

Prometheus metrics for agent decisions, CoRaL influence scores, TDA feature extraction time, memory tier hits, API latencies.

Basic guardrails: constitutional checks before execution, TDA risk signals logged.

Trace IDs propagated across API → Orchestrator → Agents.

2) Architecture Overview
Enhanced Ultimate API (FastAPI on port 8090)

Endpoints:

GET / — system overview

GET /health — health score, components

GET /components — registry snapshot

POST /process — main decision path (calls orchestrator)

POST /coral/communicate — IA↔CA test harness and metrics

POST /tda/analyze — passes to TDA adapter; returns topology_score and basic features

GET /memory — hybrid memory status

GET /benchmark — quick synthetic test

Orchestrator (LangGraph-based)

Maintains AURAState (input, context, topology, agent_votes, decision, metrics)

Nodes for: enrich_context, compute_tda_features, coral_message_round, decide, execute, log_metrics

Postgres (or Redis) checkpointer for durability

Fallback paths when components degrade

Agent Layer (200+ components)

Role assignment: ~100 IA (world-model summarizers), ~100 CA (decision executors)

IA produce 16–64D message embeddings (compressed features of context+memory)

CA consume IA messages; compute actions; log ActionRecord

CoRaL Layer

Message encoder/decoder (simple MLP or small transformer encoder)

Causal influence loss: KL divergence or delta in action logits with vs without IA message

Influence scores logged per interaction

TDA Adapter

Converts orchestrator context to TDA input

Calls your 112-algorithm engine (through a stable interface)

Extracts: topology_score, betti summary, persistence entropy, anomaly flags

Caches results in warm tier keyed by signature hash

Hybrid Memory Manager

Hot (DRAM): Active workflow state, recent IA messages, latest topology signatures

Warm (PMEM-backed Redis/NVDIMM): learned patterns, TDA signatures, DPO preference pairs

Cold (NVMe or object store): historical ActionRecords, archived signatures

Adaptive tiering based on recency/frequency/size

Learning Layer

DPO trainer over ActionRecord confidences (no reward model)

Periodic batch train; outputs preference-aware policy weights for CA

Safe on/off via feature flags

3) Implementation Tasks (Work Breakdown)
A. Component Registry & Role Assignment

Build a registry that enumerates 200+ components and annotates each with role (IA/CA)

Provide /components endpoint summary

B. CoRaL Communication Minimal

IA: implement get_message(context)-> message_vec (16–64 dims)

CA: implement decide(context, message)-> action + logit info

Causal Influence: compute difference in CA logits with vs without message (or KLDiv) and log aggregate influence per cycle

Add /coral/communicate endpoint to run a micro-round trip test

C. TDA Adapter

Implement adapter function: analyze_topology(payload)-> {topology_score, betti, entropy, anomaly}

Leverage existing HTTP/gRPC or Python-callable interface to the 112-algorithm engine

Cache by signature hash in warm tier

Add /tda/analyze endpoint

D. Hybrid Memory Manager

Implement 3-tier manager with simple policies:

Recent/active: DRAM dict/LRU

Learned patterns & signatures: Redis with PMEM/NVDIMM config

Archive: local disk/DB path

Add /memory endpoint to report hit ratios and tier usage

E. DPO on ActionRecords

Batch job: scan ActionRecords, make preference pairs using confidence deltas

Train minimal DPO network to score action quality (no inference path inside hot path initially)

Store model snapshot in warm tier; expose toggles to use in CA decision step later

F. Orchestrator (LangGraph)

Define AURAState: input, features, messages, decision, metrics

Nodes:

enrich_context: fetch memory, prep features

compute_tda_features: TDA adapter call + cache

coral_message_round: IA message, CA decision, influence metrics

decide: consensus/threshold rule

execute: simulate/action; log ActionRecord

log_metrics: push Prometheus metrics

Add circuit breakers for TDA or Redis failures with fallback

G. Enhanced API Integration

Wire orchestrator handlers behind /process

Implement /benchmark to run a short pipeline with synthetic load

Ensure CORS, timeouts, structured error responses

H. Observability

Prometheus metrics:

aura_api_latency_seconds histogram

aura_coral_influence score summary

aura_tda_latency_ms histogram

aura_memory_tier_hits counter{tier}

aura_decision_confidence histogram

aura_component_active gauge

Health scoring:

weighted sum of component health, memory hit-rate, error rate, TDA latency

I. Run Integration (with your runner)

Ensure enhanced_ultimate_api_system.py starts API on :8090

Confirm run_enhanced_system.py dependency checks, redis start, background server, test suite hits endpoints

project root

run_enhanced_system.py # your provided runner (we’ll keep, slightly improve messages if needed)

5) Data Flow (Process Path)
/process

Input payload → orchestrator(enrich_context)

compute_tda_features() via adapter → returns topology_score & features

coral_message_round(): IA produces msg → CA runs decision with/without msg → influence computed → decision selected

execute(): apply decision (or simulate), create ActionRecord

log_metrics(): send metrics, update memory tier stats

Return: decision, confidence, topology_score, influence_score, latency

/coral/communicate

Generates a synthetic or sampled real context → IA message → CA decision → returns influence score & telemetry

/tda/analyze

For isolated TDA testing; calls adapter, returns {topology_score, betti, entropy, anomaly, latency_ms}

/memory

Reports DRAM/PMEM/Storage occupancy, hit rates, eviction counts

6) Rollout & Testing Plan
Phase 0 (Day 1–2)

Component registry seeded to 200 components; IA/CA role assignment deterministic.

API skeleton + health/overview + components endpoints.

Hybrid memory manager stubbed; /memory returns structure.

Phase 1 (Day 3–5)

TDA adapter wired; /tda/analyze working with caching.

Orchestrator minimal pipeline: enrich_context → compute_tda → decide (no CoRaL yet) → execute → log_metrics.

Prometheus metrics exposed.

Phase 2 (Day 6–8)

CoRaL minimal integration: IA encode → CA decide with influence metrics; /coral/communicate online.

Orchestrator coral_message_round node added.

Validate end-to-end /process with CoRaL path (feature-flag toggled).

Phase 3 (Day 9–10)

DPO batch training job reads ActionRecords; preference pairs; metrics logged.

Optional: gate CA decision by DPO score (feature flag default off).

Phase 4 (Day 11–12)

Load/benchmark route; tune tiering thresholds; finalize metrics dashboards.

Harden error paths; finalize documentation.

7) How to Run (with your runner)
Prerequisites

Redis installed locally; PMEM config if available (optional—falls back to normal Redis).

Python deps: fastapi, uvicorn, redis, numpy, langgraph, prometheus_client, structlog, requests.

Start

python3 run_enhanced_system.py

Runner will:

Check deps

Start Redis (or confirm)

Launch enhanced_ultimate_api_system.py on :8090

Run smoke tests:

GET /, /health, /components

POST /process (synthetic payload)

POST /coral/communicate

POST /tda/analyze

Verify

Expect messages similar to:

✅ Root endpoint working

✅ Components: 200 total, ~200 active

✅ Processing: XX ms, N components used

✅ CoRaL Communication: True

✅ TDA Analysis: Score 0.83

8) Risks & Mitigations
TDA latency spikes under heavy loads

Mitigation: warm-tier cache by signature hash; async prefetching; circuit-breakers.

CoRaL overhead affects P99

Mitigation: cap IA msg size to ≤64 dims; compute influence on sampled subset; batch decisions.

Memory tiering misconfiguration

Mitigation: conservative defaults; metrics-first tuning; safe falls back to DRAM-only.

Learning instability (DPO)

Mitigation: run as offline batch; only deploy weights behind flag; evaluate against offline holdout.

9) What’s Already Prepared vs. Remaining
Prepared

API routes design

Orchestrator nodes and state design

Minimal CoRaL flow and influence metric

Hybrid memory policies and keys

DPO trainer integration points

Prometheus metric plan

Remaining (to code and wire)

Component registry population (200 entries)

IA encoders and CA deciders (thin layers) to integrate with your current agents

TDA adapter bindings to the 112-engine endpoint

Memory manager adapters for PMEM-backed Redis (uses your environment)

LangGraph graph assembly and checkpoint storage

API handlers that call orchestrator steps

10) Next Actions (Immediate)
Confirm PMEM availability (or run Redis normal mode).

Provide the stable call signature for your 112 TDA engine (HTTP or Python call).

Approve default IA message dimension (32 by default).

Approve ActionRecord store location for DPO batch (warm tier path).

I will then:

Populate the component registry (200), IA/CA split, and register into the orchestrator.

Implement CoRaL minimal flow and wire /coral/communicate.

Wire TDA adapter and /tda/analyze.

Finish /process orchestration path and metrics.

Validate end-to-end with your run_enhanced_system.py.

If approved, I will proceed with the implementation exactly per this design, wire it into enhanced_ultimate_api_system.py, and ensure it runs cleanly via your runner.
