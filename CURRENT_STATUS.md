# Current Import Status

## üö® YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT!

You have `(aura_venv)` in your prompt, but Python is still using system Python:
- Python: `/usr/bin/python3`
- Should be: `/home/sina/projects/osiris-2/aura_venv/bin/python3`

## To Fix:

1. **Deactivate and reactivate your environment**:
```bash
deactivate
source /home/sina/projects/osiris-2/aura_venv/bin/activate
which python3  # Should show venv path
```

2. **Or use the full path**:
```bash
/home/sina/projects/osiris-2/aura_venv/bin/python3 TEST_AURA_STEP_BY_STEP.py
```

## What I've Fixed So Far:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:
1. **real_registry.py** - Fixed indentation errors
2. **streams.py** - Added dummy EventProcessor for when aiokafka not available
3. **Memory aliases** - HierarchicalMemoryManager points to HierarchicalMemorySystem
4. **Consensus** - Works! All imports successful
5. **Agents** - Works! (without langgraph features)
6. **Events** - Fixed producers/consumers optional imports

### ‚ùå Current Blockers:
1. **msgpack** - Not installed (needed by memory)
2. **asyncpg** - Not installed (needed by persistence)
3. **aiokafka** - Not installed (needed by events)
4. **langgraph** - Not installed (needed by agents)

## Working Components (when deps available):
- ‚úÖ Consensus (SimpleConsensus, RaftConsensus, ByzantineConsensus)
- ‚úÖ Agents (basic functionality)
- üîß Memory (needs msgpack)
- üîß Persistence (needs asyncpg)
- üîß Events (needs aiokafka)
- üîß Neural (needs torch)

## About simple.py ‚Üí hybrid_consensus.py

Still a good idea to rename it! The file implements:
- Event ordering for 95% of decisions (fast)
- Raft consensus for 5% critical decisions (safe)
- It's a hybrid approach, not simple!

## Next Step:

Use your actual virtual environment:
```bash
/home/sina/projects/osiris-2/aura_venv/bin/python3 TEST_AURA_STEP_BY_STEP.py
```

This should have all the dependencies installed!
