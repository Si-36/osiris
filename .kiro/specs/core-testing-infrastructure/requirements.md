# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines the requirements for establishing a comprehensive testing infrastructure for the AURA Intelligence core system. The goal is to create a robust, automated testing environment that validates all system components including TDA engines, multi-agent orchestration, observability systems, and enterprise features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured testing environment, so that I can run comprehensive tests on the AURA Intelligence system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a virtual environment THEN the system SHALL install all dependencies from requirements.txt
2. WHEN I activate the environment THEN pytest SHALL be available and functional
3. IF dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and installation guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run unit tests, so that I can validate individual components work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run pytest tests/unit/ THEN all unit tests SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN unit tests run THEN they SHALL test core components like agents, TDA engines, and observability
3. IF unit tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run integration tests, so that I can validate system components work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run integration tests THEN they SHALL test multi-component workflows
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL validate agent orchestration and TDA processing
3. IF external services are needed THEN the system SHALL provide Docker-based alternatives

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and load tests, so that I can validate system performance under stress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run load tests THEN they SHALL simulate realistic system loads
2. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL measure latency, throughput, and resource usage
3. IF performance targets are not met THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want chaos engineering tests, so that I can validate system resilience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run chaos tests THEN they SHALL simulate various failure scenarios
2. WHEN chaos experiments run THEN they SHALL validate automatic recovery mechanisms
3. IF resilience issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis
