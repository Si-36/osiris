# Advanced AI System Evolution - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the evolution of our AI system from the current intelligent integration to a world-class advanced AI system featuring bio agents, consciousness systems, and cutting-edge research implementations. We will clean, consolidate, test, and enhance everything to create the best possible foundation before advancing to bio-inspired and consciousness-based AI.
