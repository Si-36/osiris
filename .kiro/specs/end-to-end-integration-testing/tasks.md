# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the end-to-end integration testing design into discrete, manageable coding tasks. The approach prioritizes discovery and validation of the current system state, then incrementally connects existing components into a fully traceable workflow. Each task builds on the previous ones and focuses on making the actual system visible, connected, and testable.

## Success Criteria

Each task completion should result in:

1. **Visible Progress**: Clear evidence that the specific integration point is working or identified as broken
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Quantitative metrics showing system behavior and performance
3. **Actionable Results**: Specific next steps or fixes identified from task execution
4. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of findings, procedures, and recommendations

## Implementation Notes

- **Start Small**: Begin with task 1.1 (system status validation) before proceeding to more complex integration work
- **Incremental Progress**: Each task should build working functionality that can be demonstrated and validated
- **Real System Focus**: All tasks should work with the actual existing codebase, not create parallel or theoretical implementations
- **Immediate Feedback**: Each task should provide immediate visibility into system state and behavior
- **Error-First Approach**: Prioritize identifying and documenting what's broken before building new functionality

This implementation plan ensures that every task directly contributes to making the AURA Intelligence system more connected, observable, and reliable.
