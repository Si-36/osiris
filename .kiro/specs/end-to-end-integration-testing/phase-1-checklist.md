# Phase 1: System and Integration Validation Checklist
**Timeline: Weeks 1-2**

## Pre-Phase Setup
- [ ] Confirm all team members have access to the AURA Intelligence repository
- [ ] Verify development environment is set up with required dependencies
- [ ] Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and functional
- [ ] Create dedicated branch for integration testing work: `feature/end-to-end-integration-testing`

## Week 1: System Discovery and Health Assessment

### Day 1-2: System Status Validation
- [ ] **Execute system health check**
  - [ ] Run `python core/check_system_status.py`
  - [ ] Document output in `integration-test-results/week1-system-status.md`
  - [ ] Record which services are UP/DOWN: Neo4j, Redis, Kafka, Temporal, Prometheus, Grafana
  - [ ] Note any port connectivity issues or Docker container problems
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Verify this uses existing `core/check_system_status.py` file

- [ ] **Start required services if needed**
  - [ ] Execute `docker-compose -f core/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
  - [ ] Wait for all services to be healthy (may take 2-3 minutes)
  - [ ] Re-run system status check to confirm all services are operational
  - [ ] Document any services that failed to start and remediation steps taken

- [ ] **Enhance system status checker**
  - [ ] Extend `core/check_system_status.py` with detailed connectivity tests
  - [ ] Add service-specific health checks (Neo4j query test, Redis ping, etc.)
  - [ ] Create structured JSON output format for automated parsing
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: All changes must be in existing `core/check_system_status.py`

### Day 3-4: End-to-End Test Execution
- [ ] **Locate or create end-to-end test**
  - [ ] Check if `core/test_end_to_end_gpu_allocation.py` exists
  - [ ] If missing, create minimal version based on `core/src/aura_intelligence/workflows/gpu_allocation.py`
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Test must use actual `GPUAllocationWorkflow` class

- [ ] **Execute end-to-end test without mocks**
  - [ ] Run the test and capture complete output
  - [ ] Document execution trace showing each workflow step
  - [ ] Record timing for each step (availability check, cost calc, council voting, etc.)
  - [ ] **Critical**: Identify which steps use real components vs. mocks

- [ ] **Document integration gaps**
  - [ ] Create `integration-test-results/week1-integration-gaps.md`
  - [ ] List each broken integration point with:
    - Component names and file paths
    - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
    - Error messages or mock usage
    - Specific line numbers where fixes are needed
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: All gaps must reference actual files in `core/src/aura_intelligence/`

### Day 5: Gap Analysis and Prioritization
- [ ] **Create integration gap priority matrix**
  - [ ] Categorize gaps by impact: Critical (blocks end-to-end flow), High (affects functionality), Medium (affects observability)
  - [ ] Estimate effort for each gap: Small (< 4 hours), Medium (4-8 hours), Large (> 8 hours)
  - [ ] Create fix order: Critical/Small first, then Critical/Medium, etc.

- [ ] **Plan Week 2 fixes**
  - [ ] Select top 3-5 gaps that can be fixed in Week 2
  - [ ] Create specific tasks for each gap with file paths and expected outcomes
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Each task must specify exact files to modify

## Week 2: Critical Integration Fixes

### Day 6-8: Replace Mocks with Real Components
- [ ] **Fix LNN Council Agent Integration**
  - [ ] Locate mock in `gather_council_votes()` method in `gpu_allocation.py`
  - [ ] Replace with actual `LNNCouncilAgent.process()` calls
  - [ ] Test that real agents are invoked and return valid votes
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Must use existing `core/src/aura_intelligence/agents/council/lnn_council.py`

- [ ] **Fix Neo4j Decision Storage**
  - [ ] Add call to `Neo4jAdapter.add_decision_node()` in allocation workflow
  - [ ] Verify decisions are actually stored in Neo4j database
  - [ ] Test data retrieval to confirm persistence
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Must use existing `core/src/aura_intelligence/adapters/neo4j_adapter.py`

- [ ] **Fix Redis Context Caching**
  - [ ] Add context caching calls using `RedisAdapter.cache_context_window()`
  - [ ] Verify cache hits and TTL behavior
  - [ ] Test cache retrieval for subsequent requests
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Must use existing `core/src/aura_intelligence/adapters/redis_adapter.py`

### Day 9-10: Event Flow and Observability
- [ ] **Implement Kafka Event Verification**
  - [ ] Create simple Kafka consumer to verify events are published
  - [ ] Test event ordering and completeness
  - [ ] Document event schema and timing
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Must integrate with existing Kafka setup in Docker Compose

- [ ] **Add Basic Tracing**
  - [ ] Add structured logging with request IDs to each workflow step
  - [ ] Implement timing measurements for performance baseline
  - [ ] Create trace output that shows complete request flow
  - [ ] **Anchor Check**: Must preserve existing logging structure

## Phase 1 Completion Criteria

### Technical Deliverables
- [ ] **Working End-to-End Flow**
  - [ ] GPU allocation request can be submitted and traced through entire system
  - [ ] Real LNN agents make decisions (no mocks)
  - [ ] Decisions are stored in Neo4j
  - [ ] Context is cached in Redis
  - [ ] Events are published to Kafka
  - [ ] Complete execution takes < 30 seconds

- [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - [ ] System status report with all service health details
  - [ ] Integration gap analysis with specific fixes applied
  - [ ] End-to-end test execution log with timing data
  - [ ] Updated system architecture diagram showing connected components

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **All services operational**: Neo4j, Redis, Kafka, Temporal, Prometheus, Grafana
- [ ] **Zero mocks in critical path**: LNN agents, data persistence, event publishing
- [ ] **Data consistency verified**: Same request data appears in all storage systems
- [ ] **Performance baseline established**: Timing measurements for each workflow step
- [ ] **Error handling functional**: System gracefully handles component failures

### Handoff to Phase 2
- [ ] **Create Phase 2 setup document**
  - [ ] List all working integration points
  - [ ] Document remaining gaps for Phase 2
  - [ ] Provide performance baseline metrics
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting guide for common issues

- [ ] **Code review and merge**
  - [ ] All Phase 1 changes reviewed and approved
  - [ ] Feature flags added for all new functionality (default: OFF)
  - [ ] Integration tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Documentation updated in repository
