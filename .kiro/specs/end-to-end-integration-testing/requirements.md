# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical need for comprehensive end-to-end integration testing in the AURA Intelligence system. Currently, individual components (GPU allocation workflows, LNN council agents, consensus protocols, memory adapters) exist and function in isolation, but there's no way to verify that they work together as a complete system. This creates a significant gap in our ability to validate system behavior, debug issues, and ensure that changes to one component don't break the overall flow.

The end-to-end integration testing capability will provide a single, traceable path from initial request through all system components, with clear visibility into each step, failure points, and system state changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want to trigger a complete GPU allocation workflow and trace it through every system component, so that I can verify the entire system works as designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit a GPU allocation request THEN the system SHALL process it through Temporal workflow orchestration
2. WHEN the request reaches LNN agents THEN the system SHALL log the agent decision-making process
3. WHEN LNN agents make recommendations THEN the system SHALL route them to the council voting mechanism
4. WHEN council voting occurs THEN the system SHALL record all votes and consensus results
5. WHEN consensus is reached THEN the system SHALL store the decision in Neo4j
6. WHEN the decision is stored THEN the system SHALL trigger the actual GPU allocation
7. WHEN each step completes THEN the system SHALL emit events to Kafka for traceability
8. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure point

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to see real-time status of all system components during integration testing, so that I can identify bottlenecks and failures quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration testing starts THEN the system SHALL verify all required services are running (Neo4j, Redis, Kafka, Temporal, Prometheus, Grafana)
2. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL report which specific services are down and their expected ports
3. WHEN the test runs THEN the system SHALL display progress through each integration point
4. WHEN components communicate THEN the system SHALL log the data flow between them
5. WHEN the test completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all component interactions
6. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL measure and report latency at each step

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to validate that new components integrate properly with existing workflows, so that I can ensure system cohesion as we add capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new adapters are added THEN the integration test SHALL verify they connect to existing workflows
2. WHEN orchestration patterns change THEN the test SHALL validate backward compatibility
3. WHEN feature flags are modified THEN the test SHALL verify both enabled and disabled states work correctly
4. WHEN memory adapters are updated THEN the test SHALL confirm data persistence across the full workflow
5. WHEN consensus algorithms change THEN the test SHALL validate decision-making still functions end-to-end

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging system issues, I want detailed tracing of data flow through all system components, so that I can identify exactly where problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request enters the system THEN each component SHALL log its input, processing, and output
2. WHEN data transforms between components THEN the system SHALL record the transformation details
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture the full context and state at the failure point
4. WHEN the trace completes THEN the system SHALL provide a complete audit trail from start to finish
5. IF components are missing or misconfigured THEN the system SHALL identify the specific integration gaps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want automated validation that all integration points work correctly, so that I can catch regressions before they impact production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL automatically validate all component connections
2. WHEN Docker Compose services start THEN the test SHALL verify network connectivity between services
3. WHEN workflows execute THEN the test SHALL confirm expected data appears in each storage system
4. WHEN the test suite completes THEN the system SHALL generate a pass/fail report for each integration point
5. IF any integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps
6. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL confirm the platform is ready for new development or deployment
