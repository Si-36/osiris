# Core Cleanup & Consolidation - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the core cleanup design into actionable coding tasks that will systematically clean up the massive `core/src/aura_intelligence` directory, eliminate duplicates, and create a unified, working system.

- [ ] 10. Create integration layer and communication bus
  - Build `SystemIntegration` class to manage all component interactions
  - Implement unified event bus for component communication
  - Create component registry for centralized component management
  - Test all component integrations work correctly after consolidation
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 2.6_

- [ ] 11. Implement comprehensive testing suite
  - Create unit tests for all consolidated components
  - Build integration tests validating component interactions
  - Implement performance tests ensuring no degradation after cleanup
  - Create regression tests to validate all functionality preserved
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 12. Validate system functionality and performance
  - Run comprehensive test suite on consolidated system
  - Perform end-to-end testing of all major workflows
  - Validate that bio-agents, council agents, and LNN systems all work correctly
  - Benchmark performance to ensure no degradation from cleanup
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 13. Create unified documentation and examples
  - Write comprehensive documentation for consolidated system architecture
  - Create usage examples showing how to use unified interfaces
  - Document migration guide for any external code using old interfaces
  - Generate API documentation for all consolidated components
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 4.6_

- [ ] 14. Final integration testing and production readiness
  - Test integration with existing aura/ directory systems
  - Validate compatibility with bio-agents, knowledge graphs, and performance systems
  - Run stress tests and validate system stability under load
  - Create deployment guide for consolidated system
  - _Requirements: 4.7, 4.8_

## Success Criteria

Each task must meet these criteria:
- **Functionality Preservation**: All existing capabilities remain working
- **No Regressions**: Comprehensive testing validates no functionality lost
- **Clean Architecture**: Unified interfaces and consistent patterns
- **Performance**: No degradation in system performance
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing aura/ systems

## Post-Cleanup Readiness

After completing this cleanup, the system will be ready for:
- **Option A**: Agent Orchestration with clean, unified agent systems
- **Option B**: Advanced AI Evolution with consolidated neural and memory systems  
- **Option C**: Custom Directions with flexible, modular architecture

The consolidated system will provide a solid foundation for all advanced AI development while maintaining compatibility with existing bio-agents, knowledge graphs, and performance optimizations.
