# Core Cleanup & Consolidation - Requirements

## Introduction

The `core/src/aura_intelligence` directory has become massive with duplicated functionality, scattered components, and unclear organization. We need to clean, consolidate, test, and properly connect everything before advancing to orchestration, advanced AI, and consciousness systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Directory Structure Analysis & Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, organized directory structure with no duplicates or confusion, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze the directory structure THEN I SHALL identify all duplicate and overlapping functionality
2. WHEN I review components THEN I SHALL categorize them by purpose and eliminate redundancy
3. WHEN I clean up directories THEN I SHALL maintain only the best-in-class implementations
4. WHEN I reorganize structure THEN I SHALL follow clear architectural patterns
5. WHEN I finish cleanup THEN the directory SHALL be 50% smaller with better organization

### Requirement 2: Component Consolidation & Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all components properly integrated and working together, so that the system functions as a cohesive whole.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I consolidate agents THEN ALL agent types SHALL work with unified interfaces
2. WHEN I integrate memory systems THEN ALL memory components SHALL share common patterns
3. WHEN I connect neural systems THEN ALL neural networks SHALL use consistent APIs
4. WHEN I unify orchestration THEN ALL workflow systems SHALL coordinate seamlessly
5. WHEN I test integration THEN ALL components SHALL communicate without errors

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Testing & Validation

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want comprehensive testing for all consolidated components, so that I can ensure system reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run tests THEN ALL core components SHALL have 100% test coverage
2. WHEN I test integration THEN ALL system connections SHALL be validated
3. WHEN I run performance tests THEN the system SHALL meet performance benchmarks
4. WHEN I test edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully
5. WHEN I validate functionality THEN ALL features SHALL work as specified

### Requirement 4: Documentation & Architecture Clarity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and architecture diagrams, so that I can understand and extend the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read documentation THEN I SHALL understand the system architecture clearly
2. WHEN I look for components THEN I SHALL find clear module organization
3. WHEN I need examples THEN I SHALL find working code demonstrations
4. WHEN I want to extend THEN I SHALL have clear extension guidelines
5. WHEN I troubleshoot THEN I SHALL have comprehensive debugging guides

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization & Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want optimized performance with comprehensive monitoring, so that the system runs efficiently and issues are quickly identified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL use optimal resource allocation
2. WHEN I monitor performance THEN I SHALL see comprehensive metrics and dashboards
3. WHEN issues occur THEN I SHALL receive immediate alerts and diagnostics
4. WHEN I scale the system THEN it SHALL handle increased load gracefully
5. WHEN I optimize THEN I SHALL see measurable performance improvements

### Requirement 6: Bio-Agent Integration

**User Story:** As a bio-AI researcher, I want our bio-agent systems properly integrated with the core intelligence, so that biological and artificial intelligence work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use bio-agents THEN they SHALL integrate with core intelligence systems
2. WHEN bio-agents communicate THEN they SHALL use the unified communication layer
3. WHEN bio-agents learn THEN they SHALL share knowledge with neural networks
4. WHEN bio-agents evolve THEN they SHALL influence system-wide adaptation
5. WHEN I orchestrate bio-agents THEN they SHALL coordinate with other agent types

### Requirement 7: Advanced AI Foundation

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want a solid foundation for advanced AI features, so that I can implement consciousness, orchestration, and cutting-edge research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build consciousness systems THEN I SHALL have proper cognitive architecture foundations
2. WHEN I implement orchestration THEN I SHALL have clean agent coordination interfaces
3. WHEN I add advanced features THEN I SHALL have extensible system architecture
4. WHEN I conduct research THEN I SHALL have access to all necessary AI components
5. WHEN I deploy advanced AI THEN the system SHALL support production requirements

### Requirement 8: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a production-ready system with proper deployment, monitoring, and operational capabilities, so that I can maintain it reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy the system THEN it SHALL have containerized deployment configurations
2. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL have comprehensive health checks and monitoring
3. WHEN I need to scale THEN the system SHALL support horizontal and vertical scaling
4. WHEN issues occur THEN I SHALL have automated recovery and alerting
5. WHEN I maintain the system THEN I SHALL have clear operational procedures
