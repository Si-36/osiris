# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a real AI agent system that integrates with actual external services using provided API keys. The system will perform genuine AI operations, store real data, and provide measurable functionality without simulation or placeholders.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real LLM Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to make actual API calls to Gemini AI, so that I can get real AI-powered responses and decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs AI reasoning THEN it SHALL make actual HTTP requests to Gemini API using the provided key
2. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the actual AI response content
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with retry logic
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff strategies
5. IF no API key is provided THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate LLM features are disabled

### Requirement 2: Honest Capability Reporting

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to only claim capabilities it actually has, so that I can trust what it reports as working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system reports a feature as "enabled" THEN that feature SHALL actually work with real external services
2. WHEN external dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL report those features as "disabled" or "unavailable"
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL only pass tests for functionality that genuinely works
4. WHEN displaying status THEN the system SHALL distinguish between real and simulated capabilities

### Requirement 3: Real Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to store actual data persistently, so that information survives between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system stores data THEN it SHALL write to actual files or databases on disk
2. WHEN the system retrieves data THEN it SHALL read from persistent storage
3. WHEN the system restarts THEN previously stored data SHALL be available
4. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors and report them clearly

### Requirement 4: Measurable Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real performance metrics, so that I can understand actual system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL measure actual response times
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track real latency and success rates
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log actual error details and frequencies
4. WHEN reporting metrics THEN all numbers SHALL reflect genuine system performance

### Requirement 5: Transparent Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to verify real functionality, so that I can trust the system actually works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL make actual API calls to verify connectivity
2. WHEN testing storage THEN tests SHALL write and read actual files
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the underlying functionality SHALL genuinely work
4. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN tests SHALL clearly indicate what's not working
5. WHEN running in CI/test mode THEN the system SHALL use test API keys or mock services explicitly

### Requirement 6: Clear Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily configure real API keys and settings, so that I can enable actual functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are provided THEN the system SHALL use them for real service calls
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
3. WHEN invalid credentials are used THEN the system SHALL report authentication failures clearly
4. WHEN updating configuration THEN changes SHALL take effect without requiring code changes

### Requirement 7: Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work partially when some services are unavailable, so that I can still use available features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external AI services are down THEN the system SHALL continue working with local-only features
2. WHEN API quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform users and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate timeouts and retries
4. WHEN services are restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume full functionality
