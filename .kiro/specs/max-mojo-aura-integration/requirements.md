# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating the ultimate MAX/Mojo integration with AURA Intelligence System B. The goal is to leverage Modular's MAX engine and Mojo language to create a high-performance, GPU-accelerated AI system that integrates seamlessly with our existing AURA Intelligence components while providing 100-1000x performance improvements over standard Python implementations.

The integration will transform our current ultimate_api_system into a production-ready, MAX-powered API that serves as System B in our three-system architecture, providing agentic AI capabilities with unprecedented performance.
