## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Module Size**: Each module must be <150 lines and single-responsibility
- **TDA Integration**: All modules must integrate with existing TDA infrastructure
- **Testing**: Each task must include comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: All interfaces and integration points must be documented
- **Feature Flags**: All new functionality must be feature-flagged for progressive rollout

### TDA Infrastructure Leverage
- **Event Mesh**: Use existing Kafka infrastructure for all inter-agent communication
- **Feature Flags**: Leverage TDA feature flag system for orchestration rollouts
- **Observability**: Integrate with TDA tracing and metrics for full visibility
- **Testing**: Use TDA chaos and load testing frameworks for validation

### Progressive Implementation
- **Phase-by-Phase**: Complete each phase fully before moving to the next
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each component with TDA integration immediately
- **Rollback Ready**: Ensure each phase can be rolled back without affecting TDA
- **Documentation**: Update documentation continuously with each implementation

This implementation plan ensures the orchestration system builds incrementally on the robust TDA foundation while incorporating cutting-edge 2025 research patterns for maximum reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
