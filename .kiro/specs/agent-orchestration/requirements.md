# Agent Orchestration System Requirements

## Introduction

The AURA Intelligence system currently lacks the orchestration capabilities that were referenced but not implemented. This spec defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive agent orchestration system that enables multi-agent workflows, state coordination, and graph-based agent coordination.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workflow Engine Implementation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a WorkflowEngine that can coordinate multiple agents in complex workflows, so that I can build sophisticated multi-agent processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is defined with multiple steps THEN the WorkflowEngine SHALL execute each step in the correct order
2. WHEN an agent fails during workflow execution THEN the WorkflowEngine SHALL handle the failure gracefully with retry logic
3. WHEN a workflow requires conditional routing THEN the WorkflowEngine SHALL support branching logic based on agent outputs
4. WHEN a workflow needs to be paused THEN the WorkflowEngine SHALL support checkpoint creation and resumption
5. WHEN multiple workflows run concurrently THEN the WorkflowEngine SHALL manage resource allocation and prevent conflicts

### Requirement 2: Workflow State Management

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want centralized state management for workflows, so that agents can share data and coordinate their actions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to share data THEN the WorkflowState SHALL provide thread-safe state updates
2. WHEN a workflow step completes THEN the WorkflowState SHALL persist the results for subsequent steps
3. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the WorkflowState SHALL support rollback to previous checkpoints
4. WHEN querying workflow status THEN the WorkflowState SHALL provide real-time progress information
5. WHEN workflows are distributed THEN the WorkflowState SHALL maintain consistency across nodes

### Requirement 3: LangGraph Integration

**User Story:** As an AI engineer, I want LangGraph-based orchestration capabilities, so that I can leverage graph-based agent coordination patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining agent relationships THEN the LangGraphOrchestrator SHALL create executable agent graphs
2. WHEN executing agent graphs THEN the LangGraphOrchestrator SHALL handle message passing between agents
3. WHEN agents need conditional routing THEN the LangGraphOrchestrator SHALL support dynamic graph execution
4. WHEN integrating with existing agents THEN the LangGraphOrchestrator SHALL work with current BaseAgent implementations
5. WHEN handling errors in graphs THEN the LangGraphOrchestrator SHALL provide error recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Agent Coordination Patterns

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want common agent coordination patterns, so that I can quickly implement standard multi-agent scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing pipeline patterns THEN the system SHALL support sequential agent execution
2. WHEN implementing fan-out patterns THEN the system SHALL support parallel agent execution with result aggregation
3. WHEN implementing consensus patterns THEN the system SHALL support multi-agent decision making
4. WHEN implementing hierarchical patterns THEN the system SHALL support supervisor-worker agent relationships
5. WHEN implementing event-driven patterns THEN the system SHALL support reactive agent coordination

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the orchestration system to work seamlessly with existing AURA components, so that current functionality is preserved and enhanced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing agents THEN the orchestration system SHALL work with current BaseAgent, ObserverAgent, etc.
2. WHEN using quality metrics THEN the orchestration system SHALL integrate with the QualityMetrics system
3. WHEN using evidence collection THEN the orchestration system SHALL work with existing evidence schemas
4. WHEN using decision making THEN the orchestration system SHALL integrate with existing decision frameworks
5. WHEN using memory systems THEN the orchestration system SHALL work with UnifiedMemory

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the orchestration system to be performant and scalable, so that it can handle enterprise-level workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing workflows THEN the system SHALL support at least 100 concurrent workflows
2. WHEN coordinating agents THEN the system SHALL minimize latency between agent communications
3. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support distributed workflow execution
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on workflow execution times
5. WHEN handling large workflows THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and prevent resource leaks

### Requirement 7: Observability and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive observability into workflow execution, so that I can debug and optimize multi-agent processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution traces
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL log all inter-agent messages
3. WHEN workflows fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error diagnostics
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide workflow execution metrics
5. WHEN debugging workflows THEN the system SHALL support step-by-step execution modes
