# Real LNN Council Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This spec defines the requirements for implementing **real** LNN (Liquid Neural Network) council agent integration in the AURA Intelligence system. The goal is to replace mock/simplified decision logic with actual AI-powered decision making using the sophisticated LNN architecture we've built.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real LNN Council Agent Implementation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the LNN Council Agent to use real neural network inference for GPU allocation decisions, so that we have genuine AI-powered decision making instead of hardcoded logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GPU allocation request is submitted THEN the LNN Council Agent SHALL use real neural network inference to make decisions
2. WHEN the LNN processes a request THEN it SHALL incorporate context from Neo4j knowledge graphs
3. WHEN making decisions THEN the agent SHALL use memory integration with Mem0 for learning from past decisions
4. WHEN inference is complete THEN the system SHALL return confidence scores based on actual neural network outputs
5. IF the LNN agent fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to a simpler decision mechanism

### Requirement 2: Abstract Method Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LNNCouncilAgent to properly implement all abstract methods from AgentBase, so that it can be instantiated and used in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LNNCouncilAgent is instantiated THEN it SHALL implement `_create_initial_state` method
2. WHEN workflow steps are executed THEN it SHALL implement `_execute_step` method  
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN it SHALL implement `_extract_output` method
4. WHEN the agent is created THEN it SHALL properly initialize without abstract method errors
5. IF any abstract method is called THEN it SHALL execute real business logic, not placeholder code

### Requirement 3: Configuration System Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the LNN Council Agent to use a consistent configuration system, so that it integrates properly with the rest of the AURA Intelligence platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent is initialized THEN it SHALL accept both dictionary and AgentConfig formats
2. WHEN configuration is provided THEN it SHALL properly extract LNN-specific settings
3. WHEN default values are needed THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults for neural network parameters
4. WHEN configuration validation occurs THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid settings
5. IF configuration is missing THEN it SHALL use default values that enable basic functionality

### Requirement 4: Neural Network Subsystem Integration

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want the LNN Council Agent to properly initialize and use all neural network subsystems, so that we get the full benefit of the sophisticated LNN architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent starts THEN it SHALL initialize the ContextAwareLNN with proper configuration
2. WHEN processing requests THEN it SHALL use LNNMemoryHooks for background indexing
3. WHEN making decisions THEN it SHALL query the knowledge graph for relevant context
4. WHEN inference is complete THEN it SHALL update memory systems with new learnings
5. IF any subsystem fails THEN it SHALL log detailed error information and attempt graceful degradation

### Requirement 5: End-to-End Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests that verify real LNN integration works end-to-end, so that we can be confident the AI decision making is functioning correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use real LNN inference, not mocks
2. WHEN decisions are made THEN tests SHALL verify neural network outputs are reasonable
3. WHEN memory systems are used THEN tests SHALL verify learning and context retrieval
4. WHEN knowledge graphs are queried THEN tests SHALL verify relevant context is found
5. IF any component fails THEN tests SHALL provide detailed diagnostics about what went wrong

### Requirement 6: Performance and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want detailed observability into LNN decision making performance, so that I can monitor and optimize the AI system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LNN inference runs THEN it SHALL emit detailed performance metrics
2. WHEN decisions are made THEN it SHALL log confidence scores and reasoning paths
3. WHEN memory systems are accessed THEN it SHALL track query performance and hit rates
4. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL provide detailed stack traces and context information
5. IF performance degrades THEN it SHALL emit alerts with actionable diagnostic information

### Requirement 7: Fallback and Resilience

**User Story:** As a system reliability engineer, I want the LNN Council Agent to have robust fallback mechanisms, so that GPU allocation continues working even if advanced AI features fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LNN inference fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to rule-based decision making
2. WHEN memory systems are unavailable THEN decisions SHALL proceed without historical context
3. WHEN knowledge graph queries fail THEN decisions SHALL use available request data only
4. WHEN any subsystem is degraded THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality
5. IF all AI features fail THEN the system SHALL use simple cost/availability logic as final fallback

## Success Criteria

- Real LNN neural network inference is used for all GPU allocation decisions
- All abstract methods are properly implemented with real business logic
- Configuration system works seamlessly with existing AURA Intelligence components
- End-to-end tests demonstrate actual AI decision making, not hardcoded logic
- System maintains high availability even when advanced AI features encounter issues
- Performance metrics show reasonable inference times (< 2 seconds per decision)
- Memory and knowledge graph integration demonstrably improves decision quality over time
