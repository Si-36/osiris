# Project Structure Cleanup & Reorganization - Requirements

## Introduction

The current project structure has become a massive, unorganized mess with duplicate directories, scattered components, and poor organization. We have duplicate `core` folders, 25+ scattered directories in `aura_intelligence`, and a structure that's impossible to maintain or navigate efficiently. This feature will completely reorganize the project into a clean, modern, maintainable architecture following 2025 best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Eliminate Duplicate Directory Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, clear directory structure without duplicates, so that I can easily navigate and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN there SHALL be only one `core` directory location
2. WHEN looking for components THEN each component SHALL have exactly one canonical location
3. WHEN navigating the project THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or redundant directory paths
4. WHEN importing modules THEN import paths SHALL be consistent and predictable

### Requirement 2: Consolidate Scattered Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all related components grouped logically together, so that I can find and work with related functionality efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for agent-related code THEN all agents SHALL be in a single `agents/` directory
2. WHEN working with neural networks THEN all neural components (lnn, tda) SHALL be grouped under `neural/`
3. WHEN accessing orchestration features THEN all orchestration code SHALL be in `orchestration/`
4. WHEN using observability features THEN all monitoring/metrics code SHALL be in `observability/`
5. WHEN working with infrastructure THEN all infrastructure code SHALL be in `infrastructure/`

### Requirement 3: Create Clean Module Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a logical, hierarchical module structure, so that I can understand the system architecture at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the top-level structure THEN it SHALL follow the pattern: `aura/[domain]/[component]/[files]`
2. WHEN looking at any directory THEN it SHALL have a clear, single responsibility
3. WHEN navigating directories THEN the depth SHALL not exceed 4 levels for core functionality
4. WHEN viewing the structure THEN related components SHALL be grouped together logically

### Requirement 4: Implement Modern Python Package Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern Python package structure with proper `__init__.py` files, so that imports work correctly and the package is properly organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing from any module THEN imports SHALL use absolute paths from the root package
2. WHEN examining directories THEN each directory SHALL have an appropriate `__init__.py` file
3. WHEN using the package THEN it SHALL follow modern Python packaging standards (PEP 518/621)
4. WHEN installing the package THEN it SHALL be installable via `pip install -e .`

### Requirement 5: Consolidate and Organize Test Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests organized in a clear structure separate from source code, so that I can run and maintain tests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for tests THEN all tests SHALL be in a dedicated `tests/` directory
2. WHEN running tests THEN tests SHALL be organized by type: unit, integration, e2e
3. WHEN examining test files THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or redundant test files
4. WHEN running `pytest tests/` THEN all tests SHALL be discoverable and runnable

### Requirement 6: Remove Redundant and Broken Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want only working, necessary files in the project, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate implementations of the same functionality
2. WHEN looking at files THEN there SHALL be no broken or non-functional code files
3. WHEN checking imports THEN there SHALL be no broken import statements
4. WHEN running the system THEN all included files SHALL serve a clear purpose

### Requirement 7: Establish Clear Import Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent, predictable import patterns, so that I can easily import and use components throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing components THEN imports SHALL follow the pattern: `from aura.domain.component import ClassName`
2. WHEN using relative imports THEN they SHALL be avoided in favor of absolute imports
3. WHEN examining import statements THEN they SHALL be consistent across the entire codebase
4. WHEN adding new components THEN import patterns SHALL be immediately clear and followable

### Requirement 8: Create Documentation Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation that matches the new structure, so that I can understand and contribute to the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for documentation THEN there SHALL be a dedicated `docs/` directory
2. WHEN examining documentation THEN it SHALL reflect the new project structure
3. WHEN reading docs THEN they SHALL include architecture diagrams and component relationships
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear guidance on the project structure

### Requirement 9: Maintain Backward Compatibility During Transition

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to continue working during the restructuring process, so that development can continue without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring is in progress THEN existing functionality SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN moving components THEN there SHALL be a clear migration path
3. WHEN updating imports THEN changes SHALL be made incrementally and safely
4. WHEN testing during transition THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass

### Requirement 10: Validate New Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the new structure works correctly, so that I can be confident in the reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN all imports SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL pass with the new structure
3. WHEN examining the structure THEN it SHALL follow the defined architectural patterns
4. WHEN using the system THEN all functionality SHALL work as expected with the new organization
