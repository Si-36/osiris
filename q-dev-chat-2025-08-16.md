## Key Insights
- **ARCHITECTURE**: User built a production-ready system with 203+ real components, not toy implementations, focusing on reliability over chat capabilities
- **PERFORMANCE**: System achieves 10K+ items/sec throughput, sub-100Î¼s processing, 1000x energy efficiency with spiking networks
- **INTEGRATION**: Successfully connected existing component system with Ultimate API System for MAX acceleration while maintaining functionality
- **RESEARCH FOCUS**: User wants cutting-edge 2025 research integration (Homeostatic AI, Swarm Intelligence, Liquid Networks 2.0, Mixture of Depths) but applied to their existing system, not as replacement
- **DOMAIN EXPERTISE**: User's true innovation domain is "Reliable Agentic Intelligence" - solving AI hallucination and coordination problems, not competing with GPT/Claude
- **BIO-INSPIRED APPROACH**: User wants biological systems integration (immune system, metabolic constraints, swarm intelligence) for anti-hallucination and reliability
- **ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY**: User prefers enhancing existing working components rather than rebuilding, wants all latest research documented and integrated systematically
